# vite-hono-mono
inspired by bhvr.dev monorepo

this is a boilerplate for my personal SPA projects in 2025

## stack
```
client:
vue
vite
vue-router
tailwind
daisy ui
pinia
-> cloudflare pages
```
```
server:
hono
drizzle
sqlite (cloudflare d1)
-> cloudflare workers
```
```
both:
typescript
zod
bun
eslint
better auth
wrangler
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

To change the name of the server deployment on cloudflare workers:
1. Go to server/wrangler.jsonc
2. Change the name field
